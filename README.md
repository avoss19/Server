## Ease of Updating Sites

This is accomplished the [updateScript.sh](updateScript.sh) that updates
the server every minute.

## Deployment

If your html is finished and ready to be posted online, please request a merge
to master. Also place your files in a folder called your github username or
full name. Also please **DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER WITHOUT PERMISION**. If you would
like to push to master please contact the head of the project, Voss.

## Orginization

All folders in the root of this repository should be a domain name or a domain
idea. Also the main page of each domain should be labeled **index.html**. Please
also add a README.md file to your subdirectory.

## Domains
