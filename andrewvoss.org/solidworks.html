<indent><p>I have the skills and knowledge of how to use solidworks. Here is the
  <a href="http://solidworks.andrewvoss.org" target="_blank">link</a> to some of
  my solidworks projects, that includes the projects that are in the pictures at
  the top of the page. I created these parts for an Engineering course that I am
  currently in at my high school, Benilde-St. Margaret's. They are mostly lego parts
  to scale. Through these projects I learned how to create object in solidworks
  and use an Assembly. This was an important project for me due to it setting the
  foundation for creating 3D models and creating objects for realworld use.
