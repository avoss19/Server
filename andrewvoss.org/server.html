  <p>This page about a project I started called "Server". You can access the git
     repository for this project by going to <a href="https://github.com/avoss19/Server"
     target="_blank">https://github.com/avoss19/Server</a>. This project was
     created to host websites for Benilde-St. Margaret's students. Currently,
     there is only one other student and I who are involved in the project, but
     I am looking to expand.
     </p>
     <p>I got the idea for this project one day while I was browsing through
       craigslist and noticed a server for less than $100. I thought to myself
       that it would be a great place to start for hosting a domain or service.
       Then I remembered that my engineering class that I am taking requires us
       to create a portfolio for our last assignment. I thought that this server
       would be a great way for my friends and I to host our website without
       having any restrictions on our customizable to our site.
     </p>
     <p>This was one of my most challenging projects of my junior year in high
       school. It forced me to learn a plethora of things. Some of the things it
       forced me to learn were HTML, CSS, Javascript, more bash, how to use server
       equipment, and more about Linux. After the purchase of the server, my first
       task was learning some HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the site that I would
       be hosting. I learned most of it from a website called <a
       href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">https://w3schools.com</a>.
       I thought this website was very helpful and though for what I wanted to
       accomplish, and if the website didn't have what I wanted to learn I would
       go to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com</a>.
       I also learned some bash from StackOverflow for a script to run on the server
       updates the website to be live with the "master" branch on my GitHub
       <a href="https://github.com/avoss19/Server" target="_blank">repository</a>.
       Another thing I learned was how to use server equipment. It took hours of
       troubleshooting to get the server to boot for the first time. The first day
       of working the server it took 3 hours for me to figure out how to clear the
       CMOS and get the OS (operating system) to recognize a drive. I finally
       figured out that I could just change the position of a jumper to clear
       the CMOS and that I had to initialize the hard drive through the raid controller.
       I thought that utilizing the hard drive through the raid controller was
       counter-intuitive due to the hard drive bay being hot swappable. Another
       thing I learned was the Unix permission structure, I had to learn about
       this to make this project successful because I didn't want other students
       to be able to have control over my network or the entire server.
