<indent><p>This page about a project I started called "Server". You can access the git
   repository for this project by going to <a href="https://github.com/avoss19/Server" target="_blank">https://github.com/avoss19/Server</a>.
   This project was created to host websites for Benilde-St. Margaret's students.
   Currently there are only three students at my school that are involved in the
   project, but I am looking to expand.
   <br/>&emsp; I got the idea for this project one day while I was browsing through
   craigslist and noticed a server for $100. I thought to myself that it would
   be a great place to start for hosting a domain or service. Then I remembered that
   my engineering class that I am taking requires us to create a portfolio for our
   last assignment. I thought that this server would be a great way for my friends
   and I to host our website without having any restrictions on our customizablity to
   our site.</p></indent>
