<indent><p>This page about a project I started called "Server". You can access the git
   repository for this project by going to <a href="https://github.com/avoss19/Server" target="_blank">https://github.com/avoss19/Server</a>.
   This project was created to host websites for Benilde-St. Margaret's students.
   Currently there are only three students at my school that are involved in the
   project, but I am looking to expand.

   <indent><p>I got the idea for this project one day while I was browsing through
   craigslist and noticed a server for $100. I thought to myself that it would
   be a great place to start for hosting a domain or service. Then I remembered that
   my engineering class that I am taking requires us to create a portfolio for our
   last assignment. I thought that this server would be a great way for my friends
   and I to host our website without having any restrictions on our customizablity to
   our site.</p></indent>
   <indent><p>This was one of my most challanging projects of my junior year in
   high school. It forced me to learn a plethora of things. Some of the things it
   force me to learn was html, css, javascript, more bash, how to use server equiment,
   and about linux. After the purchase of the server my first task was learning some
   html, css, and javascript for the site that I would be hosting. I learned most of it from a website called
   <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">https://w3schools.com</a>. I
   thought this website was very helpful and thourgh for what I wanted to accomplished,
   and if the website didn't have what I wanted to learn I would go to
   <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com</a>.
   I also learned some bash for stackoverflow for a script to run on the server
   updates the website to be live with the "master" branch on my github <a href="https://github.com/avoss19/Server" target="_blank">repository</a>.
   Another thing I learned was how to use server equiment. It took hours of trouble
   shooting to get the server to boot for the first time. The first day of working
   the server it took 3 hours for me to figure out how to clear the cmos and get
   the OS (operating system) to recoginize a drive. I finally figured out that I
   could just change the position of a jumper to clear the cmos and that I had to
   inilized the hard drive through the raid controller. I thought that inilizing the
   hard drive through the raid controller was counter intuative due to the hard drive
   bay being hotswappable. Another thing I learn was the unix permission structure, I
   had to learn about this to make this project successful becuase I didn't want
   other students to be able to have control over my network or the entire server.
