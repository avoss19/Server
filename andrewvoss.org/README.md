# andrewvoss.org

This is the subdirectory for Voss's andrewvoss.org source code. This 
website is for Voss's portfolio and is hosted by Andrew Voss's server. 
The majority of the html was found on https://www.w3schools.com/. I 
would recommend checking their website our for helpful coding guides 
or source code. Also at the moment these photos are probably copy 
written, they are just placeholders until the majority of the site is 
finished.
